= Build an application with sample software templates

{ProductShortName} introduces ready-to-use software templates in {RHDHShortName} to expedite your application's journey to production. These templates are meticulously designed for seamless integration with Red Hat's comprehensive suite of tools ({RHDHShortName}, {RHTASShortName}, {RHTPAShortName}) and technologies. This integration furnishes a solid framework for a secure, effective, and developer-oriented SDLC within an on-premises environment.

Beyond these foundational elements, {ProductShortName}â€™s software templates include default integrations with key technologies to further secure and optimize your development lifecycle:

* *ACS (Advanced Cluster Security):* Bolsters your deployments by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities early in the development process, ensuring your applications are fortified from inception to deployment.

* *Quay:* Acts as a secure harbor for your container images, providing a reliable repository that continuously scans for vulnerabilities, keeping your containerized applications safe.

* *Tekton Pipelines:* Automates your build and deployment processes with precision, enabling a CI/CD framework that integrates seamlessly into your SDLC, thus accelerating your path to production.

* *GitOps:* Implements a GitOps strategy by maintaining your infrastructure and application configurations in Git repositories, ensuring consistent and automated deployment across all environments.

Furthermore, {ProductShortName} supports the development and containerization of applications in popular programming languages such as Java, Python, Node.js, and Go, broadening the scope for application creation.

Upon the installation of {ProductShortName}, cluster administrators have the capability to tailor the {RHDHLongName} portal with specific templates and enhancements. This customization process is crucial for enabling developers to focus primarily on coding by simplifying development workflows and mitigating concerns related to pipelines, vulnerabilities, and policies.

Before proceeding with customization, it's essential for cluster administrators to familiarize themselves with the available software and pipeline templates through this guide. Such exploration is key to grasping how {ProductShortName} supports a secure supply chain, laying the groundwork for any subsequent customization.
