I really appreciate your kind gesture and the Amazon voucher. And trust me I tried everything I could before informing you about this. The Voucher is from Amazon.com and over here in India we have Amazon.in and hence I'm unable to redeem this voucher :) I did talk to the Amazon customer service team, but as per them they can't help much here.

I'm deeply grateful for this gesture and it means a lot to me. I'd request you to please redeem this voucher in your account before it expires. I'm so humbled by your kindness.
