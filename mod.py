This is the preferred way to define multiple applications within an application category (e.g., operators) or family/product organization (e.g., Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management) as code because it allows you to make bulk configurations to your base component YAML (such as enabling multi-arch or labeling/ownership) in a single place, the component base, rather than multiple places.

I am not sure that we should call out ACM here specifically. Is there another way that we can word this?
