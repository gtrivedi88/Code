=== Dependency analytics

The Dependency Analytics plugin, available for *VS Code* and JetBrains *IntelliJ*, warns you about security risks directly in your IDE. This helps you tackle potential security issues early.

For example, as an experienced Java developer, you might want to dive into Java code using the Quarkus framework. With the Dependency Analytics plugin installed, you're ready to move on to enhancing your code while keeping an eye on security.
