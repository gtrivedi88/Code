== Making changes to your code

With access to your repository, you're ready to engage in the familiar process of working with a git repository. Here's how to proceed:

- **Clone** your repository to start working on it either locally or in your development environment.
- **Modify** your application, like updating technical docs or `index.html`, or by adding new features or bug fixes.
- **Push** your changes to apply them.

After making the necessary changes, commit your changes with a meaningful message and push them to the repository. This update triggers the {ProductShortName} pipeline, allowing you to witness the application's path to production and the activation of security measures.

After pushing updates, you might want to view at the *Image Registry* tab on {RHDHShortName} to see details about how everything is set up using ArgoCD and GitOps for smooth provisioning.
