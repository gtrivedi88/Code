I'm expecting my second child this month around March 30. My current insurance expires on March 31st and will be renewed, as per the latest notification, on April 1. Yesterday when I visited the hospital (Motherland Hospital, Noida) they suggested me to ask the team about the insurance validatity. They told me they'd be applying for the pre-approval sometime after March 20, 2024, but as they discharge will happen around Apri 2 or 3, will their isurance demand be accepted.
