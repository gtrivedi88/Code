= Building your application with software templates

With the installation of {ProductShortName}, cluster administrators can customize the {RHDHLongName} portal, tailoring it with specific templates and enhancements. This customization enables developers to concentrate solely on coding by streamlining development processes and alleviating concerns related to pipelines, vulnerabilities, and policies.

Before diving into customization, it's essential for cluster administrators to familiarize themselves with the available software and pipeline templates through this guide. Such exploration is key to grasping how {ProductShortName} supports a secure supply chain, laying the groundwork for any subsequent customization.

Adhering to best practices, Red Hat fortifies your software supply chain with critical elements such as templates, signatures, attestations, and SBOMs. This enrichment is designed to streamline the development process across all SDLC phases: coding, building, deploying, and running.

== The first step

* Ensure you have installed installed {ProductName}
* You have signed to {RHDHLongName} using the link that the {ProductShortName} provides.
