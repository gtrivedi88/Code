In the *Repository Owner* field, enter the name of the organization that you have , user , or project that this repository belongs to. You find this information in your `private-value.yaml` file.

it's quite complicated, but the org name will not be `private-value.yaml` file.
`private-value.yaml` currently only has git app integration information. each git app is tied with  an git org.
you can only input the org which you have it's corresponding git app integration set in `private-value.yaml`
