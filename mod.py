Use ready-to-use software templates to build and accelerate your application's path to production. These software templates are engineered to seamlessly integrate with Red Hat's extensive array of tools and technologies, providing you with robust framework for a secure, efficient, and developer-friendly software development lifecycle (SDLC) within an on-premise environment.

I would probably add some text that highlights that once RHTAP is installed, the platform engineer will want to tailor the developer portal with templates and customizations so that developers can  use to streamline development and empower them to just focus on code (without having to worry about pipelines, vulnerabilities, and polices). This getting started is for Platform engineers to explore the samples that we provide for software and pipeline templates, understand how RHTAP gives them the tools they need to understand if they have a secure supply chain, etc before they customize further. I would pull some language from Burr's demo. For example, he has text like, "... Red Hat imbues your software supply chain with the content, templates, signatures, attestations, and SBOMs that accelerate your custom application development across the software development lifcycle of code, build, deploy and run. This is the story of how Red Hat empowers your Platform Engineering teams who then in turn super charge your custom application developers
