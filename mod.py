This document covers the build-time tests that {ProductName} runs as part of its component build pipeline. These build-time tests automatically check all application images to ensure that they're up-to-date, correctly formatted, and protected from security vulnerabilities.
Nit: the out-of-the-box tests don't "ensure" as much as they "inform" since the tasks are non-blocking/failing.
