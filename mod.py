It's feels wholesome to work with Nicole. She is not only full of Red Hat strategically alignied ideas, but she also explains the reasons behind them and the clear direction in which we should move forward. I have had a couple of opportunities to work with Nicole (EAP and OPL) and from my experience i can tell that in both the projects she was the guiding and shinging star.
