Recently three lecturers from the University of Glasgow published a paper titled ChatGPT is Bullshit. It's a very interesting academic article and well-worth a read, but the TL;DR is the authors say that ChatGPT and other LLMs have no concern for truth because they have no real underlying understanding of the input and output they process. They also argue that labelling false output as "hallucinations" is misrepresentative as it gives the impression that an LLM has an understanding about our world.
