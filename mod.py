Every enterprise has a unique SDLC, a bespoke path to production, but there are some common attributes, you typically start with a dev environment, pre-production (e.g. staging) and then production. There are normally some rules and some triggers that promote a "build" from one environment to another. With in this golden path template we leverage ArgoCD - OpenShift GitOps to continously deploy to across dev, pre-prod and production but it does require an update to the gitops repository to cause the deployment. If you remember there were webhooks configured on the newly generated git repo for push, tag and release events. To promote this latest code change to pre-prod, you simply create a tag in GitLab which triggers a promotion-focused Tekton pipeline, which updates the gitops repository causing ArgoCD to deploy.
