This demonstration takes the audience on a journey across the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), from code, to build, through continuous deployment and finally to running in production. An end-to-end DevSecOps CI/CD demonstration of Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP) incorporating Developer Hub, a developer self-service portal based on Backstage, to standardize and expedite developer onboarding with golden path templates imbued with advanced security guardrails. RHTAP allows enterprises to identify and prevent malicious code from entering their software supply chain by automating key security capabilities such as: artifact signing, attestations, SLSA provenance and SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials). Reducing the developer onboarding time from weeks to minutes - no tickets, no waiting, all self-service. This demonstration incorporates Platform Engineering and Platform as a Product (PaaP) practices for offering a customized developer-facing self-service experience known as an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). We will be using Red Hat SSO for authentication and an in-cluster GitLab for source code management (SCM). This demonstration also includes Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) within the pipeline for CVE (common vulnerabilities and exposures), policy and yaml scanning to complete the DevSecOps story.
