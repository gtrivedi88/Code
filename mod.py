Give us a few clicks and we'll get you started on an end-to-end DevSecOps CI/CD journey with the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}). Starting with the Developer Hub, a self-service portal based on Backstage, we streamline and secure your development process from the outset. Once RHTAP is installed and configured, developers can choose an appropriate "ready-to-use" template, fill in the appropriate details and create an application. Once an application is created you can review its code repository (source code and GitOps repositories), and tech docs. Edit the source code and it triggers a pipeline run which ensures every artifact is signed and attested and scans your source-code for vulnerabilities and generates Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). You can review and fix vulnerabilities and SBOM that details the components, libraries, and dependencies included in the container image.  Additionally, depending on your promotion workflow, you can promote your application from development environment to stage and then from stage to production. This triggers another pipeline run which scans for vulnerabilities and Enterprise contract. The Enterprise Contract ensures container images produced by Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline meet clearly defined requirements before releasing them to production. Should an image fail to meet these criteria, the EC generates a report outlining the specific issues that need to be addressed.
