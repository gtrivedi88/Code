== Access and elevate your organization’s security defense
“Access and elevate” represents a two-phased approach to enhancing cybersecurity with in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Initially, it involves evaluating existing security measures across all stages of development. Following this assessment, the strategy focuses on elevating these practices by implementing advanced security solutions and adopting a DevSecOps CI/CD solution to standardize developer onboarding, expedite processes, and embed security from the start.

Framework in RHTAP

RHTAP one stop shop for building, testing, and deploying source code with secure CI/CD that incorporates best practices in SLSA level 3, to help you spot critical vulnerabilities.

Artifact scanning and management

Visibility into vulnerabilities in your software lets you proactively respond and remediate potential threats before you release your applications to your customers. RHTAP leverages RHDH (a self service developer portal), RHTAS (signature and attestations), and RHTPA to (Sofware bill of materials (SBOMs):
Scan vulnerabilities with each pull request
generate SBOMs
ensure that your container image meets SLSA guidelines by using our enterprise contract with 41+ rules.

Shift-left and shift-down security practices
"Shift-left" and "shift-down" are strategies that emphasize the early integration of security measures within the SDLC. By introducing security checks at the code entry point and embedding security practices from the moment of project creation, organizations can ensure a more secure development process from the start.


Ready-to-use software templates
RHTAP offers ready-to-use software templates play a pivotal role in this approach, providing pre-defined pathways that embed security practices directly into the development process. This not only streamlines workflow but also significantly lowers the cognitive load on developers, allowing them to focus more on innovation and less on security concerns.

[NOTE]
You can customize the ready-to-use software templates for as per your organization’s requirements.

The Path Forward
Adopting a DevSecOps mindset and uitlizing RHTAP fosters a secure, efficient development environment. This continuous journey of assessment and elevation prepares organizations to meet current and future cynbersecurity challenges head-on.
