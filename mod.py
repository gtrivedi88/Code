= Building your application with software templates

With the installation of {ProductShortName}, cluster administrators can customize the {RHDHLongName} portal, tailoring it with specific templates and enhancements. This customization enables developers to concentrate solely on coding by streamlining development processes and alleviating concerns related to pipelines, vulnerabilities, and policies.

However, before any customization, cluster administrators can use this guide to explore provided samples for software and pipeline templates. This exploration is crucial for understanding how RHTAP facilitates a secure supply chain before any further customization.

You can use ready-to-use software templates to build and accelerate your application's path to production. These software templates are engineered to seamlessly integrate with Red Hat's extensive array of tools ({RHDHShortName}, {RHTASShortName}, and {RHTPAShortName}) and technologies, providing you with robust framework for a secure, efficient, and developer-friendly software development lifecycle (SDLC) within an on-premise environment.

Emulating best practices, Red Hat enriches your software supply chain with essential components - templates, signatures, attestation, and SBOMs - to expedite custom application development through all SDLC stages: code, build, deploy, and run.

With RHTAP you can build and containerize Java, Python, Node, or Go-based applications

After a pipeline run is completed you can view:
Vulnerabilities in build artifacts.
Software bill of materials (SBOM) for the build artifacts.
Build provenance, which is a collection of verifiable metadata about a build. It includes details such as the digests of the built images, the input source locations, the build toolchain, build steps, and the build duration.
