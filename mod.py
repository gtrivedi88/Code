== Advanced Cluster Security tasks
{ProductShortName} leverages Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) to protect your deployments. If ACS is installed and configured, the status of the ACS tasks (for example, `roxctl image scan`) appears green. Otherwise, it appears greyed out.

[NOTE]
====
ACS tasks in the pipeline run are only successful if you have installed and configured ACS during the RHTAP install process. For detailed information on  ACS, refer <>.
